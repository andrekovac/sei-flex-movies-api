To run the api, firstly ensure MongoDB is installed and running locally. To see how to do this [follow these instructions]('https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/)

Once the database is running locally:

1. Install dependencies - `npm install`
2. Seed the database - `npm run seed`
3. Start the server - `npm run start:server`

<em>It may help to have nodemon installed globally on your machine</em>

`npm i -g nodemon`

Once the server is running and successfully connected to the database, you will be able to test making requests to the api using [postman]('https://www.postman.com/downloads/).

Try sending a request to `http://localhost:4000/api/movies` and you should see data returned
